# RBJPython
Implementations of Robert Bristow-Johnson filters for learning purposes

From reading eq cookbook by robert bristow-johnson
honestly I still don't understand how any of these work, and how to get the coefficients, my maths are just not good enough for this yet. However, I'll try to implement it anyway :p.


I'm not testing it automatically, but manually null testing it with reaEQ (tho the BW parameter is a pain)
needs ./audio/testaudio.wav 
To run the tests, just edit the files in ./tests/ and run it from project root directory
